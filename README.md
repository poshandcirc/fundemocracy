## Project Description

Political campaigns today face three majors challenges:
- raising small dollar donations
- fundraising beyond their immediate constituency (especially local campaigns)
- meeting FEC regulations for donation collection

On the flipside, while the everyday person may not be willing to max out a donation to a political candidate, many are interested in making small-dollar donation to candidates who they believe are going to affect change, even if beyond their own district.

We've created an iOS app that allows users to create profile containing all FEC-necessary donor information. They are prompted to rank Congressional policy categories based on their preference. Each day, the app recommends a different candidate from anywhere in the country that has policy preferences most in line with the users' to make a $5 donation towards.

Users must be 18 or older, as per FEC-donation policies. Our target audience is anyone who is interested in politics and expanding their knowledge of candidates accross the US, from city council to Congress. 

Our second target audience is candidates running for office at any level. They are incentivized to promote the app because it increases their chances that people outside their constituency reach may be interested in donating to their campaign. In addition, because we meet FEC donor information policies, they do not have to worry about finance violations. Our database can easily export both user and candidate donation history.
