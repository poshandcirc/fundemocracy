## Project Description

Political campaigns today face three majors challenges:
- raising small dollar donations
- fundraising beyond their immediate constituency (especially local campaigns)
- meeting FEC regulations for donation collection

On the flipside, while the everyday person may not be willing to max out a donation to a political candidate, many are interested in making small-dollar donation to candidates who they believe are going to affect change, even if beyond their own district.

We've created an iOS app that allows users to create profile containing all FEC-necessary donor information. They are prompted to rank Congress
